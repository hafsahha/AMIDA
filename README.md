## 📖 The Philosophy: AMIDA-MI (谧)

**AMIDA-MI** is more than a name—it's a declaration of identity and design philosophy.

### The Dualism
- **"Amida"** (*Infinite Light*) represents the chaos of innovation, endless possibilities, and the boundless nature of technology. It embodies the **Day Mode** aesthetic—clarity, focus, and structured brilliance.
- **"Mi"** (*谧* - Tranquility) represents the stability of deep logic, the calmness of understanding, and the organized nature of algorithms. It embodies the **Night Mode** aesthetic—mystery, depth, and bioluminescent wonder.

### The Origin
The name is derived from the core of my identity: **H(amida)h** (Hafsah Hamidah). It's a linguistic play that weaves my name with philosophical meaning.

### The Declaration
Phonetically, "Mi" resonates with "Me"—so **"Amida is Me."** This work is a direct reflection of my values, ambitions, and technical journey.

## 📖 About The Project

**AMIDA-MI** is a concept portfolio designed to showcase the intersection of rigorous Computer Science fundamentals and artistic digital expression.

Built for **Hafsah Hamidah**, a Software Engineer specializing in AI & Data, this platform moves beyond static resume templates. It utilizes **React Three Fiber** to create a living, breathing 3D environment that shifts between two distinct states:

* **Day Mode (The Tranquil):** A porcelain-white, foggy Zen garden representing clarity and focus.
* **Night Mode (The Stunning):** A bioluminescent, data-void ocean representing deep innovation and mystery.

## 📖 About Me

**Academic Excellence Meets Practical Innovation**

Final-year Computer Science student at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (GPA 3.84/4.00) with a passion for turning complex theories into usable software. My journey spans from Full-Stack Web Development to pioneering research in Ethnopedagogy, with a current focus on Deep Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, and Data Engineering.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Dual-Realm Atmosphere:** A global state management system (Zustand) that completely transforms lighting, fog density, materials, and typography contrast between Day and Night modes.
* **Interactive 3D Scene:** A procedural "Liquid Mirror" floor built with custom shaders (`MeshDistortMaterial`) and floating instanced geometry that reacts to mouse movement.
* **Immersive Navigation:** Instead of standard scrolling, the UI uses a "Floating Glass Pill" dock and fullscreen modal overlays for project details, maintaining a single-page application (SPA) feel.
* **Performance Optimized:** Utilizing `InstancedMesh` for particles and optimized heavy assets to ensure 60FPS rendering on modern browsers.
* **Detailed Project Showcases:** dedicated modals for technical deep-dives (Architecture, Problems, Solutions) covering AI, IoT, and Data Engineering projects.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Built with the modern **Next.js** ecosystem, focusing on performance and visual fidelity.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The design is centered around the concept of **"Liquid Logic"**. As a Computer Science student, logic is solid and structured. However, creativity is fluid. The visual identity attempts to merge these worlds:

* **Typography:** *Cinzel* (Classical/Timeless) paired with *Inter/Geist* (Modern/Technical).
* **Layout:** A "Broken Grid" masonry layout that defies rigid bootstrap templates.
* **Micro-interactions:** Magnetic buttons and cursor distortion trails that give the web a "tactile" feel.
