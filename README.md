## 📖 The Philosophy: AMIDA-MI (谧)

**AMIDA-MI** is more than a name—it's a declaration of identity and design philosophy.

### The Dualism
- **"Amida"** (*Infinite Light*) represents the chaos of innovation, endless possibilities, and the boundless nature of technology. It embodies the **Day Mode** aesthetic—clarity, focus, and structured brilliance.
- **"Mi"** (*谧* - Tranquility) represents the stability of deep logic, the calmness of understanding, and the organized nature of algorithms. It embodies the **Night Mode** aesthetic—mystery, depth, and bioluminescent wonder.

### The Origin
The name is derived from the core of my identity: **H(amida)h** (Hafsah Hamidah). It's a linguistic play that weaves my name with philosophical meaning.

### The Declaration
Phonetically, "Mi" resonates with "Me"—so **"Amida is Me."** This work is a direct reflection of my values, ambitions, and technical journey.

## 📖 About The Project

**AMIDA-MI** is a concept portfolio designed to showcase the intersection of rigorous Computer Science fundamentals and artistic digital expression.

Built for **Hafsah Hamidah**, a Software Engineer specializing in AI & Data, this platform moves beyond static resume templates. It utilizes **React Three Fiber** to create a living, breathing 3D environment that shifts between two distinct states:

* **Day Mode (The Tranquil):** A porcelain-white, foggy Zen garden representing clarity and focus.
* **Night Mode (The Stunning):** A bioluminescent, data-void ocean representing deep innovation and mystery.

## 📖 About Me

**Academic Excellence Meets Practical Innovation**

Third-year Computer Science student at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (GPA 3.84/4.00). I specialize in building scalable web applications, engineering intelligent data pipelines, and developing real-time AI solutions. My journey spans Full-Stack Development, creative technology, and research in Ethnopedagogy and Smart Systems, with a current focus on Deep Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, and Data Engineering.

This portfolio is built with Next.js, TailwindCSS, Zustand, GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), and React Three Fiber for immersive 3D experiences. The site leverages advanced animation, custom shaders, and interactive UI/UX to showcase both technical and creative skills. Every section is designed to be responsive, performant, and visually engaging, reflecting my passion for merging logic and creativity in software engineering.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Dual-Realm Atmosphere:** A global state management system (Zustand) that completely transforms lighting, fog density, materials, and typography contrast between Day and Night modes.
* **Interactive 3D Scene:** A procedural "Liquid Mirror" floor built with custom shaders (`MeshDistortMaterial`) and floating instanced geometry that reacts to mouse movement.
* **Immersive Navigation:** Instead of standard scrolling, the UI uses a "Floating Glass Pill" dock and fullscreen modal overlays for project details, maintaining a single-page application (SPA) feel.
* **Performance Optimized:** Utilizing `InstancedMesh` for particles and optimized heavy assets to ensure 60FPS rendering on modern browsers.
* **Detailed Project Showcases:** dedicated modals for technical deep-dives (Architecture, Problems, Solutions) covering AI, IoT, and Data Engineering projects.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The design is centered around the concept of **"Liquid Logic"**. As a Computer Science student, logic is solid and structured. However, creativity is fluid. The visual identity attempts to merge these worlds:

* **Typography:** *Cinzel* (Classical/Timeless) paired with *Inter/Geist* (Modern/Technical).
* **Layout:** A "Broken Grid" masonry layout that defies rigid bootstrap templates.
* **Micro-interactions:** Magnetic buttons and cursor distortion trails that give the web a "tactile" feel.
